# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised learning with the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA)

## Overview of Project
Our task for this project was to use unsupervised machine learning algorithms to analyze a cryptocurrency dataset in order to create a report that included what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment opportunity presentation. Our analysis included the following:
- Reading in the dataset from a CSV file and complete Preprocessing on the data for prepartion to perform Principal Componen Analysis (PCA)
- Reducing the data dimensions by performing PCA
- Clustering the cryptocurrencies by using the K-Means algorithm
- Visualizing the results through 2D and 3D scatter plots

## Project Visualizations
Here are the visualizations we generated as part of our analysis:

1) Elbow Curve - used to determine the best K value to use for the K-Means algorithm.<br>

2) 3D Scatter Plot - visualization of the three principal components generated from PCA with the four classes generated from K-Means.<br>

3) 2D Scatter Plot - visualization of the Total Coins Mined vs. Total Coin Supply with the four classes genereated from K-Means.<br>
